# Versions

Initially we will be doing this by hand; at some point an automation should occur.
There are two values in app/build.gradle.kts that need to be set:

- versionCode
- versionName

The basic file has the following values:

```
versionCode = 1
versionName = "1.0"
```

We table the following:
versionCode, versionName, releaseDate
```
1 1.0.0-alpha-1 20250904
2 1.0.0-alpha-2 …
```
